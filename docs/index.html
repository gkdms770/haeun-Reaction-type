        <p>This season, Lemmer decided to release a men's and women's collection during the Men's Collection. Is that why? The collection, which was released in a digital runway way, was naturally connected to each other as a couple look. In fact, designers said that it was difficult to carry out the new schedule, but on the other hand, it was an opportunity, and men's and women's teams worked hand-in-hand, picking materials and colors together.</p>

The rooftop of Brooklyn's Bisconti Garden Center, filled with palm trees and other tropical plants, gave the impression of a mirage in the city center. The set was created because it was inspired by Tulum, Mexico, which Jason Wu said was his second home.
